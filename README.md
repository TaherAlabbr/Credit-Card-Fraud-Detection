# 🛡️ Fraud Detection with Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Resampling and Modeling Strategies

This project addresses credit card fraud detection using supervised machine learning. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset (\~0.17% fraud cases), it evaluates six resampling techniques applied across **five classifiers**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, and Voting Classifier ensemble. The ensemble combines the strengths of the base models to enhance detection robustness.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), containing 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labeled as fraud.

* Features: `V1` to `V28` (PCA-transformed), `Amount`, `Time`
* Target: `Class` (1 = fraud, 0 = legitimate)

---

## 🧠 Key Highlights

* Compared six resampling methods: No resampling, Random Undersampling, NearMiss, KMeans Undersampling (custom), Random Oversampling, and SMOTE.
* Evaluated **five machine learning models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, and Voting Classifier.
* Developed a custom KMeans-based undersampler
* Optimized thresholds per model based on F1 score using validation sets.
* Conducted feature importance analysis, t-SNE visualization, and engineered key interaction features.
* Carefully avoided data leakage and ensured evaluation mimics real-world deployment.
* Conducted EDA with correlation heatmaps and fraud/normal feature comparisons
* Documented results and analysis in a professional project report
*  Wrote modular and reusable training/testing scripts with CLI support
